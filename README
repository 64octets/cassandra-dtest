Cassandra Distributed Tests
===========================


Prerequisite
------------

An up to date of ccm (https://github.com/pcmanus/ccm) should be installed.
The tests are run using nosetests (http://readthedocs.org/docs/nose/en/latest/)
which thus needs to be installed too.


Usage
-----

Tests are ran by nostests, the only thing the framework needs to know is where
is the (compliled) sources for Cassandra to use. There is two options:
 * Use existing sources:
     CASSANDRA_DIR=~/path/to/cassandra nosetests
 * Use ccm ability to download/compile released sources from archives.apache.org:
     CASSANDRA_VERSION=1.0.0 nosetests

Existing tests are probably the best place to start to look at how write
tests.

Each test spawns a new fresh cluster and tear him down after the test. If a
test fails, the logs for the node are saved in a logs/<timestamp> directory
for analysis (it's not perfect but have been good enough so far, I'm open to
better suggestsions).
